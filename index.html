                    <strong>What is multimedia</strong>
                    <p>

                        Multimedia is a form of communication that combines different content forms such as text, audio,
                        images, animations, or video into a single interactive presentation, in contrast to traditional
                        mass media which featured little to no interaction from users, such as printed material or audio
                        recordings. Popular examples of multimedia include video podcasts, audio slideshows and Animated
                        videos. <br>
                        <br>
                        Multimedia can be recorded for playback on computers, laptops, smartphones, and other electronic
                        devices, either on demand or in real time (streaming). In the early years of multimedia, the
                        term "rich media" was synonymous with interactive multimedia. Over time, hypermedia extensions
                        brought multimedia to the World Wide Web.

                    <strong>What is mobile device?</strong>
                    <p>
                        A mobile device is a general term for any type of handheld computer. These devices are designed
                        to be extremely portable, and they can often fit in your hand. Some mobile devices—like tablets,
                        e-readers, and smartphones—are powerful enough to do many of the same things you can do with a
                        desktop or laptop computer.

                    In 1946, the first car-based telephone was set up in USA. The system used a single radio transmitter
                    on top of a tall building. A single channel was used, and therefore a button was pushed to talk and
                    released to listen.
                    <br>
                    This half duplex system is still used by modern day CB-radio systems used by police and taxi
                    operators. In the 60’s, the system was improved to a two-channel system called improved mobile
                    telephone system (IMTS). <br>
                    Unlike traditional computer systems characterized by short-lived connections because of their
                    nature, Streaming audio/video sessions are typically long lived (the length of a presentation) and
                    require continuous transfer of data. Streaming services will require, the delivery of enormous
                    volumes of data to customer homes. For examples, entertainment NTSC video compressed using the MPEG
                    standards requires bandwidths between 1.5 and 6 Mb/s. <br>
                    Some signaling schemes suitable for high-speed video delivery are: <br>
                    <br>
                    • ADSL: The asymmetrical digital subscriber loop (ADSL) takes advantage of the advances in coding to
                    provide a customer with a downstream wideband signal, an upstream control. The cost to the end-user
                    is quite low in this scheme, as it requires little change to the existing equipment. <br>
                    <br>
                    • CATV: Cable TV (CATV) uses a broadband coaxial cable system and can support multiple MPEG
                    compressed video streams. CATV has enormous bandwidth capability and can support hundreds of
                    simultaneous connections <br>
                    <br>

                    Client may utilize network knowledge to select the most appropriate server and mechanism to obtain
                    appropriate content. This knowledge could be entirely or partially transferred to the individual
                    servers or could reside inside the network. Image transcoding is where an image is converted from
                    one format to another (Vetro, Sun, & Wang, 2001). This may be performed by altering the Qscale
                    (basically applying compression to reduce quality). This is sometimes known as simply resolution
                    reduction. Another method is to scale down the dimensions of the image (spatial transcoding)
                    (Chandra, Gehani, Schlatter Ellis, & Vahdat, 2001) so reduce the overall byte size (e.g., scaling a
                    160Kb frame by 50% to 32KB). Another method known as temporal transcoding is where frames are simply
                    dropped (this can sometimes be known as simply rate reduction). While another method may be simply
                    to transcode the image to greyscale, which may be useful for monochrome PDA,’s (again this
                    transcoding process results in reduced byte size of the image or video frame).

                <p>
                    Mobile IP (or MIP) is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard communications protocol
                    that is designed to allow mobile device users to move from one network to another while maintaining
                    a permanent IP address. Mobile IP for IPv4 is described in IETF RFC 5944, and extensions are defined
                    in IETF RFC 4721. Mobile IPv6, the IP mobility implementation for the next generation of the
                    Internet Protocol, IPv6, is described in RFC 6275.

                <h2 id="FT"><span>FUTURE TRENDS </span></h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile phone technologies have evolved in several major phases denoted by “generations” or “G” for
                    short. Each generation is successive, more reliable and flexible than the previous. The first of
                    these is referred to as the first generation or 1G. This generation was developed during the 1980s
                    and early 1990s and only provided an analog voice service with no data services available (Bates,
                    2002). The second generation or 2G of mobile technologies used circuit-based digital networks. Since
                    2G networks are digital they are capable of carrying data transmissions, with an average speed o f
                    around 9.6K bps (bits per second). Because 2G networks can support the transfer of data, they are
                    able to support Java enabled phones. Some manufacturers are providing Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME)
                    (Knudsen & Li, 2005) phones for 2G networks though the majority are designing their Java enabled
                    phones for the 2.5G and 3G networks, where the increased bandwidth and data transmission speed will
                    make these applications more usable (Hoffman, 2002) <br>
                    The third generation of mobile communications (3G) is digital mobile multimedia offering broadband
                    mobile communications with voice, video, graphics, audio and other forms of information . 3G builds
                    upon the knowledge and experience derived from the preceding generations of mobile communication,
                    namely 2G and 2.5G although 3G networks use different transmission frequencies from these previous
                    generations and therefore require a different infrastructure (Camarillo& Garcia-Martin, 2005). These
                    networks will improve data transmission speed up to 144K bps in a high-speed moving environment,
                    384K bps in a low-speed moving environment, and 2Mbps in a stationary environment. <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the services that will be enabled by the broadband bandwidth of the 3G networks include:
                    <br>
                    • Downloadable and streaming audio and video <br>
                    • Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) <br>
                    • Send and receive high quality color images <br>
                    • Downloadable software—Potential to be more convenient than conventional methods of distributing
                    <br>
                    software as the product arrives in minutes <br>
                    • Capability to determine geographic position of a mobile device using the global positioning system
                    <br>
                    (GPS) (Barnes et al., 2003) <br>
                    <br>
                    4G technology stands to be the future standard of wireless devices. The Japanese company NTT DoCoMo
                    is testing 4G communication a 100 Mbit/s while moving, and 1 Gbit/s while stationary. NTT DoCoMo
                    plans on releasing the first commercial network in 2010. Despite the fact that current wireless
                    devices seldom utilize full 3G capabilities, there is a basic attitude that if you provide the
                    pipeline then services for it will follow.
                    Speed <br>
                    <br>
                    5G speeds will range from ~50 Mbps to over 1 Gbps. The fastest 5G speeds would be in the mmWave
                    bands and can reach 4 Gb/s with carrier aggregation and MIMO. <br>
                    Sub-6 GHz 5G (mid-band 5G), by far the most common, will usually deliver between 100 and 4400 Mbps
                    but will have a much further reach than mmWave, especially outdoors. C-Band (n77/n78) is expected to
                    be deployed by various operators by the end 2021. <br>
                    The Low-band spectrum offers the greatest range, thereby a greater coverage area for a given site,
                    but its speeds are lower than the mid and high bands. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Latency</strong> <br>
                    In 5G, the "air latency" is of the order of 8–12 milliseconds. The latency to the server must be
                    added to the "air latency" for most comparisons. Verizon reported the latency on its 5G early
                    deployment is 30 ms: Edge Servers close to the towers can reduce latency to 10–20 ms; 1–4 ms will be
                    extremely rare for years outside the lab. The latency is much higher during handovers; ranging from
                    50–500 milliseconds depending on the type of handover. Reducing handover latency is an ongoing area
                    of research and development.

                    <br>
                    Electronic mobile devices are becoming more and more powerful in terms of memory size, computational
                    speed, and color display quality. These devices can now perform many multimedia functions, including
                    rendering text, sound, images, color graphics, video, and animation. <br>
                    Technological advances in computer and telecommunications networks have also made mobile devices
                    more useful for information exchange among users. As a result, a number of new mobile products and
                    services, such as multimedia messages services and online games, can be offered to users by the
                    industry.
                    <br>
                    There is a stronger demand for high-quality multimedia contents to be used in new hardware systems.
                    Content creation involves both computer technology and artistic creativity. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><span>Sound</span></strong>
                    <br>
                    The sound can be recorded using electronic devices and stored on magnetic tapes. It can also be
                    transmitted through telecommunications systems. The traditional telephone is used to send and
                    receive waveform information of sound signals <br>
                    The sound information can be stored as raw digital data. Some sound files, such as WAVE files (with
                    extension “.wav”) used on PCs, store raw sound data. To reduce the amount of data for storage and
                    transmission, sound data are often compressed. Commonly used sound data compression methods include
                    the m-law transformation, adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM), and Moving Picture
                    Experts Group (MPEG) audio compression. <br>
                    Short sound files can be completely downloaded to mobile devices before being played. To reduce
                    waiting time for downloading long sound files, audio streaming technology can be used.
                    In a streaming system, audio data is transmitted through a network and played
                    by a mobile device as the data become available. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><span>Images</span></strong>
                    <br>
                    The imaging ability of mobile devices has been improved rapidly in recent years. Now most new mobile
                    phones are equipped with digital cameras. Software programs are available to edit an image, such as
                    to enhance its contrast and change its color appearance. Mobile devices can also be used to send or
                    receive images and browse the Web. <br>
                    An important parameter for images is the resolution, which is closely related but should not be
                    confused with the image size. Image resolution is usually measured by dots per inch (dpi). The
                    concept of resolution is often used in image printing and scanning. <br>
                    Like sound data, images need to be compressed to save storage space and transmission time. There are
                    a number of methods that can be used to compress an image. The most popular technique used for image
                    compression is the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard. <br>
                    Commonly used lossless compression methods include graphic interchange format (GIF), tagged image
                    file format (TIFF), and portable network
                    graphics (PNG). <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><span>Graphics</span></strong>
                    <br>
                    Graphics make the multimedia application attractive. In many cases people do not like reading large
                    amount of textual matter on the screen. Therefore, graphics are used more often than text. There are
                    two types of Graphics: <br>
                    • Bitmap images- Bitmap images are real images that can be captured from devices such as digital
                    cameras or scanners. Bitmap images require a large amount of memory. <br>
                    <br>
                    • Vector Graphics- Vector graphics are drawn on the computer and only require a small amount of
                    memory. <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, there are many mobile operating systems developed by different manufacturers. This makes
                    it difficult to port graphics applications from one phone model to another model. However, a few
                    systems have been adopted by more and more manufacturers. They include Symbian, Microsoft Windows
                    Mobile OS, and Linux-based mobile OS. <br>
                    There are also several graphics formats that are supported by many mobile operating systems. They
                    include Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) and Flash, open standard scalable vector graphics (SVG).
                    J2ME is a general purpose programming language for small electronic devices.It has gained widespread
                    use in mobile phones, especially for games. <br>
                    Flash was developed by Macromedia, which is now part of Adobe Systems. In addition to graphics,
                    Flash can also be used to present other types of multimedia data, such as text, sound, and
                    animation. <br>
                    SVG is an open graphics standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It is royalty
                    free and vendor independent. SVG can be used to describe vector shapes, text, bitmap images, and
                    animation. SVG files can be used for different resolutions. A number of graphics software packages,
                    such as CorelDraw and Adobe Illustrator, can output SVG files. <br>
                    <br>

                    <strong><span>Video</span></strong>
                    <br>
                    The term video refers to the moving picture, accompanied by sound such as a picture in television.
                    Video element of multimedia application gives a lot of information in small duration of time.
                    Digital video is useful in multimedia application for showing real life objects. Video have highest
                    performance demand on the computer memory and high speed internet. Digital video files can be stored
                    like any other files in the computer and the quality of the video can still be maintained. The
                    digital video files can be transferred within a computer network. The digital video clips can be
                    edited easily. <br>
                    Like audio, video can also be streamed. This is especially useful for
                    video phone calling and live broadcasting. Current mobile networks offer video calls and many
                    video-based entertainment programs, such as news and sports, which were only possible through TV
                    before. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong><span>Animation</span></strong>
                    <br>
                    Animation means presentation of a sequence of artificially created images. In video, the images are
                    obtained from a camera, while in animation, the images are drawn by hand or generated by the
                    computer. Moving pictures in animation are often synchronized with audio to create movies.
                    <br>
                    Cartoon movies had been used for entertainment long before the digital computer was invented. A
                    cartoon film must contain 24 picture frames every second to show smooth motions. This means 86,400
                    pictures for a one-hour movie; obviously it is very labor intensive. The labor cost can be reduced
                    using cel animation and key-frame animation techniques. In cel animation, the still background is
                    drawn only once and the moving part is drawn frame by frame, each on a cel, a sheet of transparent
                    material, which is placed on the background picture. In key-frame animation, a motion is decomposed
                    into important key frames and in-betweens. <br>
                    <br>
                    Simple animation can be displayed on the computer or mobile devices by simply going though a
                    sequence of images. GIF provides such function. It is useful for small animated pictures, which does
                    not require many colors or audio. It is widely used for Web page design and for MMS on mobile phones
